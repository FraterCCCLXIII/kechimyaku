# Bodhidharma

**Bodhidharma** (菩提達磨, Bōdhidharma) was a Buddhist monk who lived during the 5th or 6th century CE. He is traditionally credited as the transmitter of Chan Buddhism to China, and regarded as its first Chinese patriarch.

## Life and Teachings

Bodhidharma is said to have been born in Kanchipuram, Tamil Nadu, India. He traveled to China to spread the teachings of Buddhism, arriving around 520 CE during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang.

His most famous teaching method was the practice of *wall-gazing* (壁觀, bìguān), which involved sitting in meditation facing a wall for extended periods.

## Legacy

Bodhidharma's teachings became the foundation of Chan Buddhism, which later developed into Zen Buddhism in Japan. His emphasis on direct experience and meditation continues to influence Buddhist practice today.
